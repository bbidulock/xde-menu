[@PACKAGE@ -- read me first file.  @DATE@]: #

@PACKAGE@
===============

Package `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` was released under GPLv3 license
@DATE@.

This package provides a number of "C"-language tools for working with
the _X Desktop Environment_.  Most of these tools were previously
written in `perl(1)` and were part of the `xde-tools` package.  They
have now been codified in "C" for speed and to provide access to
libraries not available from `perl(1)`.

For screenshots and examples, see [SAMPLES](samples).

The source for `@PACKAGE@` is hosted on [GitHub][1].


Release
-------

This is the `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` package, released @DATE@.
This release, and the latest version, can be obtained from [GitHub][1],
using a command such as:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git

Please see the [RELEASE][3] and [NEWS][4] files for release notes and
history of user visible changes for the current version, and the
[ChangeLog][5] file for a more detailed history of implementation
changes.  The [TODO][6] file lists features not yet implemented and
other outstanding items.

Please see the [INSTALL][8] file for installation instructions.

installation procedure that works for most applications appears below.

This release is published under GPLv3.  Please see the license in the
file [COPYING][10].


Quick Start
-----------

The quickest and easiest way to get `@PACKAGE@` up and
running is to run the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git
    $> cd @PACKAGE@
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install `@PACKAGE@` the
quickest.  For those who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading
`./configure --help`, some compile time options can be turned on and off
before the build.

For general information on GNU's `./configure`, see the file
[INSTALL][8].
