xde-menu 0.9 - Stable release of xde-menu

This is a stable release of the xde-menu package that provides
XDG compliant menu generation for a wide range of light-weight
window managers as well as providing a pop-up and system-tray
GTK+ menu.  All of the functionality is working, including many
window-manager specific sub-menus and startup notification
completion.  This release fixes an issue with -M --menu option
handling, accomodates spurious string warnings from gcc 9.1 and
introduces lzip compressed archives.  Attached is an autoconf
tarball for building the package from source.  See TODO and
NEWS in the release for more information.
