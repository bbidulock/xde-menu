xde-menu 0.10 -- Maintenance release of xde-menu
================================================

This is the tenth release of the xde-menu package that provides XDG
compliant menu generation for a wide range of light-weight window
managers as well as providing a pop-up and system-tray GTK+ menu.  All
of the functionality is working, including many window-manager specific
sub-menus and startup notification completion.

This release is a maintenance release the updates the release build
system, generates a better NEWS file, allows annotated tags, and
maintains the release archives at lzip compression.  It also provides
better autoconf directory defaults and improves the build process more.

In addition to build improvements, this release includes the ability to
select the terminal emulation program that is used to run desktop
applications that specify `Terminal=true` in their desktop entry files,
using environment variables or X resources.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-menu/issues).
