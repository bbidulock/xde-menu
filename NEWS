Release xde-menu-0.11 released 2019-09-05
-----------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.11

0.11            xde-menu 0.11 - Maintenance release of xde-menu

    This is another release of the xde-menu package that provides XDG
    compliant menu generation for a wide range of light-weight window
    managers as well as providing a pop-up and system-tray GTK+ menu. All
    of the functionality is working, including many window-manager specific
    sub-menus and startup notification completion.

    This release is a maintenance release, primarily for bug fixes, that
    addresses all outstanding issues at the time of release. The package
    will no longer build against libgnome-menu, but only libgnome-menu-3.0,
    as the libgnome-menu build was failing and could not reasonably be
    fixed. It removes deprecated m4 macros from configure.ac and removes
    deprecated keywords from the desktop entry file.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
